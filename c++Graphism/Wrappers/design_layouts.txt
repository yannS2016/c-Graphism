we need to use layout:

we have three possible layouts:
 horizontal layout
 vertical layout
 no layout

when horizontal layout is use:
only the width of the shape is changed

when vertical layout is set:
only the shape height is changed.

now the windows comes with defautl sizes which natural sizes.

when using horizontal layout:
 if we resize so that new height > naturalHeight
 then the shape width or radius must not change

 but if newHeight < naturalHeight then the with or radius of internal shape must decrease
 proportianly

now the position of the shape must be updated accordingly based of new height

when using vertical layout:
if we resize so that new width > naturalwidth
	then the shape height must not change
but if newwidht < natural width
	the shape with or radius of shape must decrease proportionaly

we need to give the user control over layouts such that a layout can be broken:
alignnment of redrawn shaped will depend on type of layout:

when a layout is broken, we use predfine minimum dimension for all shape all place them apart depending on their
center distance from prviuos layout.

we will make the layout a member of BGIWidget
provide a member function setlayout to set the widget layout
we need layout margins(vertical and horizontal);
